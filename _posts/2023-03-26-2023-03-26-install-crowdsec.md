# Installing CrowdSec: A Fail2Ban Alternative for Your Server

In this blog post, I'm going to show you how to install and use CrowdSec as a great alternative to Fail2Ban for protecting your server.  I've found CrowdSec to be an excellent solution and I'm excited to share it with you!

## Why Choose CrowdSec Over Fail2Ban?

CrowdSec is an open-source security solution that helps protect your server from potential threats, just like Fail2Ban. However, there are some key advantages to using CrowdSec:

1. **Collaborative Defense:** CrowdSec leverages a global community of users who share threat intelligence. When one user encounters an attack, the information is shared with the entire community, providing everyone with better protection.
2. **Ease of Use:** CrowdSec has a user-friendly dashboard and an extensive set of plugins and integrations, making it easy to monitor and manage your security.
3. **Scalability:** CrowdSec is designed to handle high traffic volumes, making it ideal for growing websites.

With these benefits in mind, let's dive into the installation process!

## Installing CrowdSec

To install CrowdSec, simply follow the steps below. Please note that this tutorial assumes you're using a Linux-based server.

### Step 1: Update Your System

First, let's make sure your system is up to date. Open your terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

### Step 2: Install CrowdSec

Now, let's install CrowdSec using the following command:

```bash
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/crowdsec/crowdsec/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
sudo apt-get install crowdsec
```

### Step 3: Configure CrowdSec

After installation, you'll need to configure CrowdSec. Run the following command to launch the configuration wizard:

```bash
sudo cscli -c /etc/crowdsec/config.yaml config setup
```

Follow the prompts to set up your account and choose the appropriate plugins for your needs.

### Step 4: Enable and Start CrowdSec Service

Finally, enable and start the CrowdSec service using these commands:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable crowdsec
sudo systemctl start crowdsec
```

## Using CrowdSec Bouncers

CrowdSec bouncers are a crucial part of the system, as they enforce the security decisions made by CrowdSec. Bouncers can be thought of as agents that interact with various systems (like firewalls or web servers) to block malicious traffic based on the decisions made by CrowdSec.

### Installing a Bouncer

To install a bouncer, you'll first need to choose the right one for your needs. There are various bouncers available for different systems. In this tutorial, we'll use the `crowdsec-firewall-bouncer` as an example, which works with both `iptables` and `nftables`.

Install the bouncer by running the following commands:

```bash
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/crowdsec/crowdsec-firewall-bouncer/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
sudo apt-get install crowdsec-firewall-bouncer
```

### Configuring the Bouncer

After installing the bouncer, you'll need to configure it. Edit the `/etc/crowdsec/bouncers/crowdsec-firewall-bouncer.yaml` configuration file using your preferred text editor:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/crowdsec/bouncers/crowdsec-firewall-bouncer.yaml
```

In the configuration file, update the `api_url` and `api_key` with the correct values. You can find your API key by running the following command:

```bash
sudo cscli bouncers list
```

Your API key will be displayed in the `Key` column of the output.

Make sure to also configure the `mode` parameter according to your system's firewall. Set the value to `iptables` or `nftables`, depending on your setup.

### Enabling and Starting the Bouncer

Once you have configured the bouncer, enable and start the service with the following commands:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable crowdsec-firewall-bouncer
sudo systemctl start crowdsec-firewall-bouncer
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully installed CrowdSec and a bouncer as a Fail2Ban alternative for your server. With CrowdSec and its bouncers in place, you can enjoy better security, ease of use, and scalability for your Server.
