# What is the Blue Team Level 1 Certificate?

The BTL1 is an entry level certification into **Blue Teaming**. The course is created by [Security Blue Team](https://securityblue.team/). 

In this course you will work your way through 6 **Domains**. It also covers security fundamentals which are mandatory in order to complete the course. While I don't deep dive into the Domains, let's go ahead and start with my short review. 

## Course Overview

As I said before you will go through the `Security Fundamentals Domain` where you learn a basic skillset for **Networking** and **Physical Security**. One big takeaway is that you get an introduction with basic networking. 

The `Phishing Analysis Domain` stood out to me because you learn how emails work and how to identify phishing emails. I was impressed with just how thorough this Domain was. 

Next is the `Threat Intelligence Domain` where you learn about **threat actors**. You examine threat actor goals, get an intro to **APTs**, and how to use the **MITRE ATT&CK Framework**. 

My favorite was the `Digital Forensics Domain`. In this Domain you break down the DFIR (*Digital Forensics Incident Response*) process. It covers tools can you use, some hardware that exists to make your life easier, how to create a disk image or memory dump, and analyzing the collected information for Linux and Windows. 

The `SIEM (Security Information and Event Monitoring) Domain` was the hardest for me because I had no prior experience with SIEM. At first the labs for each Domain were hard, but as I became more familiar with **Splunk** they became more manageable. Unfortunately, there aren't any labs with open source software alternatives. 

Last but not least, is the `Incident Response Domain`. This section teaches you how you defend your company and respond to attacks. You'll learn the steps to take during an incident, and cover some basics of **CMD** and **Powershell**, which are vital in this field. 


## Exam 

You are given **24 hours** to complete the exam. Don't rush and be sure to double check your answers. You have enough time. It took me around 4.5 hours to complete the exam and I passed with 85%. I had some minor mistakes but in the end no one will ask for the failures (*I hope*).
