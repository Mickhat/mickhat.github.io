# Quick Overview

Since i rented a dedicated Server from [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/), i want to build a small cloud lab.
The current setup is proxmox as the base and my website is running as a Kernel-based Virtual Machine. 
In this VM i run a webserver and a docker container server. And of course, some more or less useful things which i don't expose for now.


# Future Goals

My future goal with my "Cloud Lab" is provide better tutorials and maybe some small projects for some communities like [Hack The Box](https://hackthebox.com/) or [Florian Dalwigk](https://discord.com/invite/X7QU7GXC2u). The Community from Florian is german, so be warned ðŸ˜›.

So i'm unsure about my next tutorial yet but stay tuned!
