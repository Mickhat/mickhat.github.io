# Whoami? 

My Name is Michael, i'm 35 years old now. I'm working for [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com) and i really love it! side fact: I'm working for HTB since july 2020. In the meantime i rented a dedicated server to deliver more tutorials ( i hope!).

## some small facts:

* I recently passed the [BTL1](https://securityblue.team/) exam and i'm doing oscp this year too. 
* I really love to chat at the [HTB discord](https://discord.gg/hackthebox).
* I've a 1337 tattoo on my knuckles (I'll post a photo soonâ„¢)

# What is Hack The Box? 

You maybe know or maybe not know what Hack The Box is.
Hack The Box is a massive, online cybersecurity training platform, allowing individuals, companies, universities and all kinds of organizations around the world to level up their hacking skills.

If you want to learn hacking i can highly recommend you to start with the [Academy](https://academy.hackthebox.com).

After you've done some modules, like [Introduction to Academy](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/introduction-to-academy) you can start with some [Linux Fundamentals](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/linux-fundamentals). If you want to dive directly into some retired machines, i recommend you the videos from [ippsec](https://www.youtube.com/c/ippsec). He also have a great search engine on his [homepage](https://ippsec.rocks/).


This is just a quick way to say that i'm still alive!
If you want to chat with me, contact me either on Discord(Mickhat) or email me to root(at)mickhat(dot)xyz.

Much love you all and we'll see us!
